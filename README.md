Problem: As a climber, I find it difficult to keep track of all the routes in the Climb Central. This makes this difficult to plan projects and training sessions since I donâ€™t know which routes I have already accomplished.

Solution: A web app where I can view all routes, routes that I have accomplished, and routes that will be reset soon.

Epic#1: As a user, I should be able to view all routes

1. As a user, I should view the following information on the route:
    1. Route type: Boulder, Autobelay, Top Role, Lead
    2. Lane number: C01, C02, L01, Boulder Wall#1, Boulder Wall#2
        
        <aside>
        ðŸ’¡ A lane can contain multiple routes/problems
        
        </aside>
        
    3. Hold color: Green, Blue, etc
    4. Grade: 1 pie to 6 pie
    5. Wall Tilt: Overhang, Slab, Vertical, Roof
    6. Set date:
    7. Expected reset date:
2. As a user, I should be able to filter the routes according to:
    1. Date (Oldest, Newest)
    2. Wall Tilt
    3. Difficulty
    4. Route type
    5. Tags
        1. Currently projecting
        2. Sent

Epic#2: As a user, I should be able to track all routes that I have accomplished

1. As a user, I should be able to log my performance per route:
    1. Time
    2. number of successful attempts / repeats
    3. Notes/comments
    4. Tags
        1. Currently projecting
        2. Sent
        3. Flash

Epic#3: As a user, I should be able know the routes that will be reset soon.
